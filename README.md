# Foundations of Computer Science II Final Project
#### Name0: James Ruan
#### Period: 10

#### Project Overview
Recreation of Wordle: 
The website will be a recreation of Wordle, in which a random word from the wordle solutions list is selected and the user has to guess the word within 6 tries. The website will give color feedback based on the original Wordle rules (green for correct letter and placement, yellow for correct letter but wrong placement, gray for wrong letter). The user will see up to 6 lines of text and a text input on the bottom where they can input their guess. There may also be an option to enable hard mode (if time allows), in which all green and yellow clues must be used in subsequent guesses.

#### Tool Usage
- I will be using forms to input guesses by the user. 
- I will be using wordle word lists to import and manipulate in Python. I will use skills with strings to manage how to respond to each guess and python to generate html with feedback for each guess. I will use CSS to style the website as close to the original Wordle website as possible. I will use the python logic skills we learned in class to manage the calculations behind what color each letter should be. I will use iteration to modify the HTML with python.
