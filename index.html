    <p>Project Description - Recreation of Wordle: This website is a recreation of the popular NYT game Wordle. In it, players have 6 chances to guess a randomly selected word. The player is given visual clues on what the word is based on the letters in each of their guesses. Green indicates a letter is in the word in the correct spot, yellow indicates the letter is in the word but not in the right spot, and gray indicates the letter is not in the word. The player also has a keyboard visual at the bottom, which assists in showing each letter's color clue. If a player inputs a word that is not part of a list of valid words, the guess is rejected. The solution is randomly picked from a separate file that lists all possible wordle solutions (separate so that solutions are more commonly used words). Both lists are pulled from the Internet. The recreation mimics the original NYT game as closely as possible using HTML and CSS.</p>
